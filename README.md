# pacman.zig

[![build](https://github.com/floooh/pacman.zig/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/floooh/pacman.zig/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Like https://github.com/floooh/pacman.c, but in Zig.

Zig bindings for the sokol headers are here: https://github.com/floooh/sokol-zig

[WASM version](https://floooh.github.io/pacman.zig/pacman.html)

## Build and Run

Requires Zig version 0.9.0.

Zig installation: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Install-Zig-from-a-Package-Manager

```bash
git clone https://github.com/floooh/pacman.zig
cd pacman.zig
zig build run
```

On Windows, rendering is done through D3D11, on Linux through OpenGL and
on macOS through Metal.

On Linux, you need to install the usual dev-packages for GL-, X11- and ALSA-development.

## Experimental iOS support

NOTE: this is mostly a "it technically works" demo, the game can't be played with
touch inputs yet, only tapping is detected to get from the intro screen into
the game loop.

Since building for iOS is a cross-compilation-scenario, Xcode must be installed to
provide the iOS platform SDKs.

For the iOS simulator:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/floooh/pacman.zig
cd pacman.zig
zig build --sysroot $(xcrun --sdk iphonesimulator --show-sdk-path) -Dtarget=aarch64-ios-simulator

# start the simulator...
open -a Simulator.app

# wait until the simulator has booted up, then install the app with:
xcrun simctl install booted zig-out/bin/Pacman.app

# run the game with:
xcrun simctl launch booted Pacman.zig
```

Building for an actual device works like this, but installing and running hasn't been tested yet:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/floooh/pacman.zig
cd pacman.zig
zig build --sysroot $(xcrun --sdk iphoneos --show-sdk-path) -Dtarget=aarch64-ios
```

## Experimental web support

Building the project to run in web browsers requires the Emscripten SDK to provide
a sysroot and linker:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/floooh/pacman.zig
cd pacman.zig

# install emsdk into a subdirectory
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
cd emsdk
./emsdk install latest
./emsdk activate latest
cd ..

# build for wasm32-emscripten
zig build -Drelease-small -Dtarget=wasm32-emscripten --sysroot emsdk/upstream/emscripten/cache/sysroot
```

The resulting .html, .js and .wasm files are under `zig-out/web`.

...to build and start the result in a browser, add a 'run' argument to 'zig build', this
uses the Emscripten SDK `emrun` tool to start a local webserver and the browser.
Note that you need to hit `Ctrl-C` to exit after closing the browser:

```bash
zig build run -Drelease-small -Dtarget=wasm32-emscripten --sysroot emsdk/upstream/emscripten/cache/sysroot
```

Note that the Emscripten build currently requires a couple of hacks and workarounds in
the build process, details are in the build.zig file.
